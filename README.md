# Battleship Data Analysis
> k-means and Kaboom!

This is just a small example of my Excel skills, most specifically scatter plot charting skills.
This Excel workbook contains data and charts associated with an analysis of 20th century warships.
Please consult my blog for information about the story behind this analysis.

## Installing / Getting started

After running appropriate virus scan on the file, 
you will probably need to instruct Excel to run the contained macros and content.

## Features
